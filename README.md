# montichat

## Concept

Montichat is a Streamlit app built with the goal of playing with Generative AI, agents and a sales dataset: in the application is possible to interact with a chatbot powered by OpenAI APIs and ask questions about features of the dataset, time series data points, aggregations. It's also possible to ask to generate charts related to the dataset.

In the same app, it's possible to check the dataset itself and the related documents. 
Below a quick screencast of the app in action:
